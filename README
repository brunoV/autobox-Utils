SYNOPSIS
        use autobox::Utils;

        my @family = qw(Homer Marge Bart Lisa Maggie);

        my ($chief, @rest) = (@family->head, @family->tail);

        # $chief: 'Homer'
        # @rest: ['Marge', 'Bart', 'Lisa', 'Maggie'];

        my $salary = "too low";
        if ( $salary->is_number and $salary > 40_000 ) { say "yay!" }

        my $book_title = " how to be a klutz and still get published      ";

        # "How To Be A Klutz And Still Get Published"

        ... and more.

DESCRIPTION
    autobox::Utils provides useful methods to native Perl data types. Its
    goal is to complement autobox::Core and autobox::List::Util with methods
    that are frequently desired but can't be found there.

    Additionaly, this module will try its best to be compatible as possible
    with Moose::Autobox's interface, so that you can upgrade graciously to
    Moose::Autobox the moment you don't mind your project depending on Moose
    anymore.
